# How I created an explanatory model of domestic violence in NSW LGAs using R.

### What is explanatory analysis?
We are trying to explain why and how a phenomenon is the way it is. The key output for this type of analysis are insights.

### Background to the project
Domestic violence (DV) is recognised as a major Australian public health crisis with one in three homicide and sexual assault reports family and DV related (1). Research suggests that those at a higher risk of experiencing DV are young women (i.e., 15-24 years old), those living in rural/remotes areas; as well as areas with a higher proportion of Indigenous residents, culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) residents and those with higher unemployment rates (2,3,4). Although the research generalises to the Australian community, it would be interesting to see if this is reflected in NSW. Therefore, I hypothesize that socio-demographic and socioeconomic factors are important in explaining DV rates in NSW local government areas (LGAs). 


### Domestic violence in Australia
It is well known that gender plays a role in DV with on average, one Australian woman each week murdered by her current or former partner (5). Furthermore, the economic cost of domestic violence against women and children in Australia alone is estimated at $21.7 *billion* per year (6). As females are more prone to domestic violence related assault compared to males, I theorise that higher female population rates may increase DV occurrences. Young Australian women are less likely to comprehend the breadth and magnitude of DV-related behaviour, and experience higher reported occurrences of DV compared to older Australian women (7,8). Therefore, I theorise that higher rates of rate of young persons aged between 15-24 years old may increase DV occurrences.

Although there is limited data available, women living in rural areas experience higher risk of DV due to smaller communities, greater societal control and gender norms than metropolitan counterparts (9). Indigenous women are *45 times* more likely to experience DV compared to non-Indigenous women and *35 times* more likely to be hospitalised from DV than non-Indigenous women (10,11). 

As Indigenous people are strongly prone to domestic violence related assault, I theorise that higher Indigenous population rates may increase DV occurrences. In addition to Indigenous women, CALD women, including immigrants and refugees experience higher risk of DV due to dowry disputes, gender norms and patriarchal cultural norms compared to non-CALD women (12,13).As CALD people are prone to domestic violence related assault, I theorise that higher CALD population rates may increase DV occurrences. 

Lastly, research suggests that higher male unemployment lowers the risk of DV against women (14). Opposingly, literature also found that higher male unemployment increases DV against women (3), therefore it will be interesting to clarify this contention. Unemployed males may feel that their contribution in their relationship is reduced, with the power shifting toward the other partner who has financial means to sustain both parties. Therefore, I theorise that higher male unemployment population rates may decrease DV occurrences. 

Although DV prevention campaigns, helplines and programs are widely advertised in Australia, only 50% of DV occurrences are reported to the police, leading to a gross under-estimation of DV data and further caution in interpreting the results of the analysis.
